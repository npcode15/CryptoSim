# Cryptographic Simulator

The application simulates digital signature and various encryption algorithms to make file-contents secure. Algorithms include both Symmetric and Asymmetric type. There is an additional feature present in the application which allows one to send encrypted content to anyone via email.

Algorithms Available
--------------------
Symmetric-key Algorithms - AES, Blowfish, DES, TripleDES, RC2, RC4, TEA and Twofish
Asymmetric-key Algorithms - Asymmetric - Paillier, ElGamal and RSA
Digital Signature - Digital Security Algorithm

Lessons Learnt - Gained hands-on experience in information security and learnt to collaborate external libraries and API.
